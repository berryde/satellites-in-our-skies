# COMP6234 Data Visualisation

## Prerequisites

Node.js must be installed so that the `npx` command is available.

## Running the data story

To serve files when running the application, a HTTP web server must be used due to browser security restrictions, as described on the [module wiki](https://secure.ecs.soton.ac.uk/noteswiki/index.php?title=COMP6234/Browsers_and_d3).

To view the data story, open a shell session in the extracted directory (the shell should be opened in the same directory as `index.html`).

Execute `npx http-server -o`. A browser window will be opened with the story.
