# COMP6234 Data Visualisation

This archive contains a data story titled 'The satellites in our skies' authored and submitted by deb1g19@soton.ac.uk.

The data story has been developed using SvelteKit with TypeScript and built into minified HTML, JS & CSS.

## Prerequisites

To start a HTTP server as suggested below, Node.js must be installed so that the `npx` command is available.

This data story has been manually tested as working on the following platforms and browsers:

- Safari on MacOS
- Google Chrome on Ubuntu
- Google Chrome on Windows

## Instructions for viewing the story

In order to serve the built files when running the application, a HTTP web server must be used due to browser security restrictions, as stated on the [module wiki](https://secure.ecs.soton.ac.uk/noteswiki/index.php?title=COMP6234/Browsers_and_d3).

To view the data story, open a shell session in the extracted directory and run `npx http-server -o`. A browser window will be opened with the story.
